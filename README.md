## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information about running tests, refer to the [Create React App Testing Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. This will optimize your app for better performance and create a minified production build ready for deployment. The build is outputted in the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back! Ejecting will remove the single build dependency and give you full control over your build configuration. This is recommended only for advanced users.
